Default front page get all.

Visitor point of view:
1. Buttons:
wizards, monks, barbs, dh, wd, all.

under buttons, filter area. (looking for part).
Filter as a form for each type or all types.

Form options:
Min Paragon points,
Character Class or classes -> one, two or any, (do we need extra buttons then for each type?)
Game Type (rift, keywardens, grift -> 40, 50, 60, 1%, bounties -> act1 act2 act3 act4) (choose only one)


Feature Front page.
As a visitor I would like to see unfiltered all paginated posts on the front page.
With buttons choosing how many posts I would like to see on the front. (max 100).
endpoint => /posts?page=1&rpp=?

Feature paragon points filtering.
When I filter paragon points to min 500
Character class defaults to any
Game type defaults to rift.
And click on filter, I will get only results with mininum 500 paragon points.
endpoint = /posts?page=1&rpp=?&q=paragonMin:500
